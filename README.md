# Overview

This repository contains various files from MAT-150 Linear Algebra at Davidson College Fall 2022, Fall 2023, and Spring 2024.

## Standards based exam generator

This course ultilized standards-based grading for the exams. The files in the `Standards based exam generator` folder contains:

- Example excel gradebook
  - Some sample assignment grades from Gradescope
  - Sample Standards gradesheet, which is used for the exam generator
  - Example grade calculation sheet
- python code that generates a csv from the Standards gradesheet
- TeX templates for two short exams (Mini Exams), four 75 minute exams, and a final exam
- python code that generates individual exams based on Standards grades using the relevant template
- A list of Standards from Spring 2024
- Example exam question files. Each file contains the statement of the relevent standard instead of an actual exam question.

Since standards-based grading is not one type of grading, here is a shortened version of the description in my syllabus:
>Your exam score will be the number of standards where you have demonstrated understanding by the
end of the course.
>Each exam will have one question for each of the 4-6 new standards, based on the material since the
previous exam.
>Each midterm will also have one question for each of standards on the previous midterm. The Final
Exam will have one question for each standard in the course. Once you have demonstrated understanding of
a standard, you do not need to answer the questions on future exams.
